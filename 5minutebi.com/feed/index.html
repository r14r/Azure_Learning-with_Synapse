										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><p>I was part of a talk on the subject of migrating on-premises web workloads and their supporting databases to Azure. The session allowed attendees to get familiar with migrating web applications and their supporting data workloads to Azure.  There was far too much detail to cover in the short time we had in the workshop, so I put together a set of resources that will allow you to get deeper into the topic.</p>
<p>The links are divided up into different areas based on various migration topics. They include video, hands-on tutorials and official documentation. As this was a Microsoft talk, all the resources are from Microsoft.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><p>Azure Synapse Analytics was announced back on November 4, 2019, and could be thought of as the second generation of Azure SQL Data Warehouse.  This week the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/overview-what-is">Synapse Workspace documentation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Synapse">samples</a> were released.  This article reviews some of the new content.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When Azure Synapse analytics was <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-sql-data-warehouse-is-now-azure-synapse-analytics">announced</a>, I put together a list of introductory references, <a href="https://5minutebi.com/2019/12/04/learning-path-azure-synapse-analytics">Learning Path: Azure Synapse Analytics&#8211; An Introduction</a>, and endeavour to keep the content updated.</p>
<h3>What is Azure Synapse Analytics</h3>
<p>Azure Synapse Analytics brings together enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics into a unified and integrated service made up of various Azure Data Services.  These services leverage a new backend that combines both provisioned resources and on-demand resources that can scale to very large workloads.</p>
<p>Azure Synapse has 4 main components:</p>
<ol>
<li>SQL Analytics: Complete T-SQL based analytics
<ul>
<li>SQL pool (pay per DWU provisioned) &#8212; Generally Available</li>
<li>SQL on-demand (pay per TB processed) &#8212; (Preview)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spark: Deeply integrated Apache Spark (Preview)</li>
<li>Data Integration: Hybrid data integration (Preview)</li>
<li>Studio: unified user experience. (Preview)</li>
</ol>
<p>** Note that some services may be in Private preview.</p>
<p>An excellent overview of the various service and technologies is available in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/overview-cheat-sheet">Azure Synapse Analytics cheat sheet</a>.</p>

<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><p>As you start using macOS X for your Microsoft Azure Data development, VSCode may be just one of the many development packages that you want to set up but is one of the most important.  With the setup, having the ability to use Github as a code repository will definitely make life easier as many Azure repositories and services utilize Github.</p>
<p>What makes this difficult is that your integration will depend on which of the following authentication methods you use;</p>
<ol>
<li>Straight forward GitHub Authentication, User ID and PW</li>
<li>2 Factor which is in addition to option 1</li>
<li>Are a member of any organizations, such as Microsoft Docs</li>
</ol>
<p>The following overview will cover various options you may face while setting up VSCode with GitHub integration.</p>
<p>Some developers prefer to use the command line with GIT, but I prefer to use <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> as my primary interface.  Let&#8217;s install these two applications before tackling the integration.</p>
<p><strong><em>Warning</em></strong>_: Every machine is different. This walk-through is provided as an illustration and covers a base machine install. No guarantee or warranty is provided or implied.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This article assumes that this is not the first time installing an application. Some screens shots will be displayed, but any steps with simple choices are provided as written detail.</p>
<h2>Step 1 &#8211; Install GIT onto macOS X</h2>
<ol>
<li>From the main <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">GIT Downloads</a> website, select the latest version,  <strong>Download X.XX.X for Mac</strong> button in the iMac graphic.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//GitonaMac1.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>This downloads the installer from the SourceForge website. You should see this in your browser download folder.  The screengrab below shows how this looks in Microsoft&#8217;s Edge browser for the Mac.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//DownloadedGitFile.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Click the link <strong>Open the file</strong>.  On a Mac, when you click on a Zip file that contains multiple files, it will unzip into a folder matching the zip archive&#8217;s file name.</p>
<ol>
<li>This shows the install package, click once to install.  (On a PC a double click, just a little difference between the two systems.)</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//GitInstall1.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>This will bring up a warning message, which may differ depending on your security setup.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//GitInstall2.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<ol>
<li>You have to click with the <strong>Control</strong> key depressed to bring up a dialogue that allows you to authorize and allow the macOS to open it.</li>
</ol>
<p>This brings up an <strong>Open</strong> dialogue, select <strong>Open</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//GitInstall3.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>This brings up the option to &quot;Open&quot; or install the package.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//GitInstall4.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Select <strong>Open</strong>.  This brings up the installation dialogue.  Follow the steps until the installation is complete.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//GitInstall5.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>macOS X will display a system dialogue and request your password to allow the installation.  This is the OS, not the installation package asking for your password and permission !!!<br>
This example is being run on a macOS based device with Touch ID. Your dialogue may be slightly different.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//GitInstall6.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>You should see this dialogue below when complete.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//GitInstall7.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Now onto the next step.</p>
<h2>Step 2 Install GitHub Desktop onto Mac OS X</h2>
<p>The steps to install GitHub Desktop follow the same general process as above.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//GitHubDesktopOnaMac.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<ol>
<li>Clicking on the <strong>Download for macOS</strong> button will download a ZIP file to your download folder.  The screengrab below shows how this looks in Microsoft&#8217;s Edge browser.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//GithubdesktopInstall2.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>When you click on a ZIP file in macOS, it will unzip to a folder or file in the folder where the ZIP file resides, in this case, the Download folder, as shown below.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//GithubdesktopInstall3.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>You may have to hold down <strong>Control</strong> to open the app, but I was able to click on the app in the Download folder, and the following dialogue came up.</li>
</ol>

<p>The remainder of the dialogues are self-explanatory, just follow along.</p>
<p>Further documentation on how to use GitHub Desktop can be found in the site&#8217;s documentation; <a href="https://help.github.com/en/desktop">GitHub Desktop Documentation</a></p>
<h2>Step 3 Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode)</h2>
<h2>Main Install</h2>
<p>Using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> as your source code editor allows you to use the same editor across numerous platforms, Windows, Linux and macOS, while having direct integration with GIT (GitHub in our examples). This brings the ability to have a full code editor, which brings functions such as; syntax highlighting, code completion, code refactoring, and snippets. Features such as the ability to change the themes, keyboard shortcuts and many configuration preferences allow you to create the editing experience you prefer for your workflow.</p>
<ol>
<li>Installing VSCode is as simple as going to the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode portal</a> and clicking download on the main portal.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//vscodeinstall1.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>This option will take you to the <strong>Getting Started</strong> page. If you get the following pop-up, which could be different depending on which browser you use, you can save a copy or run the installer directly after download.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//vscodeinstall2.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="VSCode install page" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>This, as the previous step, will provide a ZIP file that will unzip the application in the download folder.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//vscodeinstall3.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="VSCode app in the download folder" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>You will get a warning and have to hold down <strong>Control</strong> to open the app, but I was able to click on the app in the Download folder, and the following dialogue came up.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//vscodeinstall4.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="VSCode Open Error on Mac" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Holding down the <strong>Control</strong> key and clicking on VSCode will bring up the following dialogue.  Select <strong>Open</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//vscodeinstall5.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>This then brings up a dialogue that you can use to open the application.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//vscodeinstall6.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Once Open, you could copy the app from the Download folder to the application folder, as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//vscodeinstall7.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>Configuration of VSCode</h2>
<p>Rather than a full how-to on using VSCode, see the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics">Getting Started</a> page for more. This section will provide a brief interface walk-through in addition to reviewing the configuration of VSCode for Github.</p>

<h2>Setup and Connect VSCode to use GitHub on a macOS X</h2>
<p>VSCode has numerous extensions, of which integration with GitHub is one of them. By selecting the <strong>Extensions</strong> icon, you can search and browse various extensions. We will step through the <strong>GitHub Pull Request</strong> installation.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//vscodeinstall9.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="A screenshot of the GitHub Pull Request" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>As shown above,</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Extensions</strong> icon</li>
<li>Enter &quot;GitHub&quot; in the search box</li>
<li>And select the GitHub extension.</li>
<li>Selecting <strong>Install</strong> will install the extension</li>
<li>Clicking <strong>Repository</strong> will take you to the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github">GitHub Pull Request Extension repository website</a> where more documentation can be found. Normally the documentation appears in the detail window below in Details.</li>
<li>Bring up the Sign In dialogue into the Command Bar, hitting <strong>Command Shift P</strong>, type <strong>GitHub Pull</strong> into the bar and select <strong>Sign Into Github</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//GitHubPullRequest1.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>This brings up a Browser Window.  Note: I have Microsoft Edge as the default browser on my machine.</p>
<p>Copy the Token listed on the below screen print and <strong>Click Continue</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//GitHubPullRequest2.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>This will bring up an authorization to open VSCode from the browser.  You will notice an option with your token below, copy and save it just in case you need it for the following step.  (Needed if you use two-factor or are a member of an organization)</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//GitHubPullRequest3.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>You will see the following message;</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//GitHubPullRequest4.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//GitHubPullRequest5.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Note that if this does not succeed, you can put the Authorization Token, <strong>Manually Provide Authentication Response</strong> setting.  Click on the SIGN in to Github.com in the bottom right, the status bar.</p>
<h2>2 factor Authtication &#8211; Just in case</h2>
<p>If you have an organization that has enabled two-factor authentication or have yourself, macOS needs a workaround that works for macOS in VSCode and the git command line.  When you have the token from the step above or my preference is to set up an access token from the &quot;developer settings&quot; in GitHub site and generate a &quot;personal access token,&quot; as illustrated below.  You will be able to de-authorize this later by doing this set of steps. A further step will use this token in VSCode to authorize GitHub access.</p>
<p>You can use that token with your password when logging into VSCode, and that seems to work in most instances.  Results may vary with your setup.</p>
<ul>
<li>Log into Github.com, under your account, select <strong>Settings</strong>.<br>
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/a-screenshot-of-a-cell-phone-description-automati-18.png?w=620&amp;ssl=1" alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated"></li>
<li>After Selecting <strong>Settings</strong>, at the bottom of the next page is a tab for <strong>Developer Settings</strong>, select this.<br>
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/a-screenshot-of-a-cell-phone-description-automati-19.png?w=620&amp;ssl=1" alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated"></li>
<li>On the Developer Settings menu, select <strong>Generate New Token</strong>.<br>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/a-screenshot-of-a-cell-phone-description-automati-20.png?w=620&amp;ssl=1" alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated"></li>
<li>The screen now displays and allows us to provide the access VSCode needs by using this token. Select the <strong>repo</strong> checkbox. Also, put in a name for this token as you can edit or delete this token later in addition to having multiple tokens.<br>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/a-screenshot-of-a-social-media-post-description-a.png?w=620&amp;ssl=1" alt="A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically generated"></li>
<li>At the bottom of the list, you can then select <strong>Generate Token</strong>.<br>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/a-screenshot-of-a-cell-phone-description-automati-21.png?w=620&amp;ssl=1" alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated"></li>
<li>You will now see the token. Copy this token as you cannot view it once you leave the page.<br>
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/a-screenshot-of-a-social-media-post-description-a-1.png?w=620&amp;ssl=1" alt="A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically generated"></li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have a token let&#8217;s finish setting up our VSCode extension.</p>
<ol>
<li>To use this token, we have to execute the <strong>&#8216;GitHub: Set Personal Access Token&#8217;</strong> command in the VSCode <strong>Command Prompt</strong>. Type <strong>Ctrl+Shift+P</strong> in VSCode to open the command prompt window and type &#8216;GitHub: Set Personal Access Token.&#8217; You will then be prompted to enter the token generated from GitHub.<br>
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/a-screenshot-of-a-flat-screen-television-descript.png?w=620&amp;ssl=1" alt="A screenshot of a flat-screen television Description automatically generated"></li>
<li>Enter the token in the prompt, Hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/a-screenshot-of-a-cell-phone-description-automati-22.png?w=620&amp;ssl=1" alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated"></p>
<p><strong>A Third Option</strong>  If you are asked for a user name and password, enter your Github user ID and put in the token you created on the GitHub site, developer settings, as the password.  You should not be asked for this again.</p>
<p>There are some strange issues when using two-factor authentication and a member of an organization. I was able to use the GitHub Developer settings method to get the authorization working.</p>
<p>SO,</p>
<p>You should now see your ID in the status bar.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//GitHubPullRequest8.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>Lets Open a Project to test this out</h2>
<p>Now that we have VSCode connected, we can connect to a repository and begin. We will go to your GitHub account and create a repository.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to your <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> repository listing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new repository using the <strong>New</strong> button.<br>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica-1.png?ssl=1" alt="A screenshot of a computerDescription automatically generated"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up your details for the repository by filling in the screen, as shown in the below example. Select the <strong>Create repository</strong> button to continue.<br>
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/a-screenshot-of-a-cell-phone-description-automati-23.png?ssl=1" alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you have the repository, get the <strong>clone</strong> link, by selecting the drop-down shown below.<br>
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/a-screenshot-of-a-cell-phone-description-automati-24.png?ssl=1" alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the code that was supplied for my example.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/steveyoungca/PythonTutorial.git">https://github.com/steveyoungca/PythonTutorial.git</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open up GitHub Desktop, which will bring up the following screen. Select the <strong>Clone a repository from the Internet</strong> option.<br>
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/a-screenshot-of-a-cell-phone-description-automati-25.png?ssl=1" alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This will bring up the following <strong>Clone a Repository</strong> screen. Select the <strong>URL</strong> tab and paste in the GIT Repository URL from step 4 . Notice the default directory created in the <strong>Local Path</strong> text box. Select the <strong>Clone</strong> button to begin.<br>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/a-screenshot-of-a-cell-phone-description-automati-26.png?ssl=1" alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This brings up the GitHub Desktop menu, which will show the repository. You also see the <strong>Open in Visual Studio Code</strong> option, as we set that as default in an earlier step. Select this option.<br>
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/a-screenshot-of-a-cell-phone-description-automati-27.png?ssl=1" alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VSCode opens the project in the local directory. The files are displayed in the Explorer, and the GitHub status is the highlight on the bottom.<br>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/c-users-styoung-appdata-local-temp-snaghtml3e7e9e.png?ssl=1" alt="C:\Users\styoung\AppData\Local\Temp\SNAGHTML3e7e9e7c.PNG"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a file or make a change to the Readme.md.  Save the file, and you will notice the Source Control Pending Changes icon has a message with the number of files that have been modified and need to be checked in.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//GitInstall9.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="number of files needed to be checked in" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Click on the notification, which will bring up the list of changes you have made.  Add in a Message and hit <strong>Command Enter</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//vscodeinstall10.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Once you hit <strong>Command Enter</strong> with your message, your commit to your local machine repository is complete.  You will see the message at the bottom of VSCode change to a 1 with an up arrow signifying you have a commit to push to GitHub master branch for the project.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//vscodeinstall11.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Now, Click on the 1 with the up arrow to push your changes to the repo.</p>
<p>You will now see the numbers disappear as your push was successful.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/5minutebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03//vscodeinstall12.png?w=736&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: It is important to note that the example we are running through is very simple. I use these tools in a single developer workflow and use this process to keep code versioning and the ability to save the project off the computer into GitHub.
If you work with a team of developers, you may check out and create your own branch. When you are finished your changes, you will merge your changes back into the Master branch. Proper code hygiene and working with Git is beyond the scope of this article, however using this process, you can certainly keep your own code in check if you will. A more detailed set of documentation is available on GIT in the article <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows">Distributed Git – Distributed workflows</a>. This link is part of a full set of documentation on GIT.</p>
<h2>Final Wrap up</h2>
<p>Setting up VSCode integration with GitHub can be different if you have 2-factor authentication or are a member of another organization.  I hope this helped !!!.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><a href="https://www.petermckinnon.com/">Peter Mckinnon</a>:   <br>&#8220;<strong>Done is better than perfect.</strong>&#8221;   </p>



<p>I saw this quote on one of Peter&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3DkFux8Iv-aYnTRWzwaiBA">YouTube videos</a>.  It hit me as really inspiring.  I have found so many of his videos a source of inspiration.  Take a look at his video, <a href="https://youtu.be/U-z62UyKm-Y">How to do EPIC PRODUCT PHOTOGRAPHY!.</a>  I re-watch it every now and then to see how the passion for what you do can also drive passing your knowledge on to others, which can be so impactful. </p>



<p>How many times have we thought of something and never saw it through?  Where would you be today if you just finished something you did not see-through?   They add up, don&#8217;t they.</p>



<p>P.S. I took that photo.  I post it here after taking Peter&#8217;s advice on looking through your photos and finding those that just need a little love in LightRoom and share it out.  I have picked up my Nikon DSLR, dusted off the lense and taken a few photo walks over the last few weeks.  I really forgot how much I loved photography.   </p>

You may already have one available, but you can also get a trial subscription <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/sql-data-warehouse/">here</a>. However, there are 12 free months of selected services and a $200 azure credit to try other services. ** Always shut down your Azure SQL DW when not in use ** For training or tying out services, I usually keep them in one resource group and delete that resource group when I am finished in order to keep costs down.</p>
<p>The following PDF contains a lab that walks you through the creation of an environment with an Azure SQL Databases and a SQL Data Warehouse. <a href="https://github.com/steveyoungca/LearningPlans/blob/master/Hands-On-Lab-SQL-DW-AzureSetUp.pdf">Hands-On-Lab-SQL-DW-AzureSetUp</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><h2>Guided Technical Enablement &#8211; Agile Learning</h2>
<p>As technology professionals, we are working during some of the most challenging times in our ability to keep up with the volume of new cloud-based products and services. To survive in this environment, we need to adopt various learning techniques and <strong>Guided Technical Enablement</strong> is an example of <strong>Agile Learning</strong> using a <strong>Learning Path</strong> is one of them.</p>
<p>I define Agile Learning as picking up what knowledge you need when you need it while going deep on a topic where you need to. You may not need to become an expert or do this all at once but will come back to a topic over time. You also may need to go deep on a topic at a later point, find more resources. The key to a path is that it be kept up to date, adding new material as it changes and also removing old material when need be.</p>
<p>As an example, let&#8217;s say your organization would like to add Azure SQL Data Warehouse to the technology stack. You might start off with a quick introduction, to talk about solution architecture or need to pick ups specific topic and come back later. Once a project starts to ramp up, you may need to learn the tool in more depth. That is where this series of <strong>Learning Paths</strong> can help. A curated series of resources that builds from an introduction to more in-depth concepts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong> &#8211; Azure SQL Data Warehouse is a good example as on November 4, 2019, it was updated and branded as Azure Synapse. The Learning Paths for this topic have been updated with new material and also a new Path for the Azure Synapse Analytics product set added. See bottom of article for listing of current paths.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>Onboarding with New Technology</h2>
<p>I have always had a desire to give back to the community that has helped me get where I am today. As a Cloud Solution Architect for Microsoft, one of my primary responsibilities is the technical enablement of our Data &amp; AI Partners and Customers. One of the most significant challenges is getting people within these groups up to the same level of skill and knowledge.</p>
<p>The goal of these learning paths is to allow those new employees or people new to the technology through a process that gets them to a higher level where they can be integrated into the production flow. Once they have a base level of knowledge, the more senior consultants/developers can provide more field knowledge and real-world experience. This is where learning paths come into play.</p>
<p>The Learning Paths are designed to take the student from an introductory level to an expert using a curated and guided set of resources. These resources are self-learn, free and easily consumed. Some of the labs and tutorials require you to have an Azure subscription or a copy of the software; however, a trial subscription or demoware is normally available.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Learning Path Structure &#8211; Levels</h2>
<p>The process is structured by splitting the paths into different levels. I try to keep this consistent between the different Learning Paths. The levels, defined in the table below, provide a structure to the process. Feel free to take these and customize them for your organization by including code or client examples that introduce your practice and development techniques.</p>

<h2>Learning Path Structure &#8211; Learning Styles</h2>
<p>Students have preferences as to how they like to learn &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Each of the four main styles provides a more effective method of learning based on each student&#8217;s learning preference. The four patterns and techniques used in these paths are as follows:</p>
<table>

<tr>
<th><strong>Learner Type</strong></th>
<th><strong>Preferred Training Method</strong></th>
<th><strong>Learning Path Example</strong></th>

<p></p>



<p>As of June 21, 2019 the exams, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-dp-200.aspx">Exam DP-200: Implementing an Azure Data Solution</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-dp-201.aspx">Exam DP-201: Designing an Azure Data Solution</a> have changed.  The exams look to be more focused in order to differentiate between a data engineer role from a database administrator role.  The end of the post contains the summaries that explain these changes available on the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/default.aspx">Microsoft learning</a> site. </p>



<p>The Microsoft learning site also includes <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/browse/?products=azure&amp;resource_type=learning%20path&amp;roles=data-engineer">free learning courses</a> through step by step learning path.</p>



<h3>Exam DP-200 Update Summary</h3>



<p>This exam has been refocused to differentiate the data engineer from a database administrator, emphasizing the data engineer’s proficiency in&nbsp;<em>implementing</em>&nbsp;solutions for data storage in varying forms, structures, and purpose.</p>



<p>Updated content areas (effective June 21, 2019)</p>



<ul><li>Reorganized implementation of data storage solutions to two key categories: relational and non-relational data stores</li><li>Removed focus on HDInsight</li><li>Merged monitoring and optimization</li><li>Reduced focus on Hybrid data scenarios</li><li>Removed Azure DevOps pipelines</li><li>Referenced authentication and authorization as applicable</li><li>Referenced data policies and standards as applicable</li><li>Referenced notifications as applicable</li></ul>



<p>For more details, <a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE36VQe">download the DP-200 change document</a> (Adobe Acrobat PDF).</p>



<h3>Exam DP-201 Update Summary</h3>



<p>This exam has been refocused to differentiate the data engineer from a database administrator, emphasizing the data engineer’s proficiency in&nbsp;<em>designing</em>&nbsp;solutions for data storage in varying forms, structures, and purpose.</p>



<p>Updated content areas (effective June 21, 2019)</p>



<ul><li>Reorganized design of data storage solutions to two key categories: relational and non-relational cloud data stores</li><li>Removed focus on HDInsight</li><li>Reduced focus on Hybrid data scenarios</li><li>Referenced authentication and authorization as applicable</li><li>Referenced data policies and standards as applicable</li><li>Referenced notifications as applicable</li></ul>



<p>For more details, <a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE36LwA">download the DP-201 change document</a> (Adobe Acrobat PDF).</p>



<p>I passed both exams before the changes and did find them quite broad.  In looking at these changes the definitely look more focused in dividing the material between designing and administration.  Look at the detailed synopsis, especially if you were already studying for the exam,   <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-dp-200.aspx">Exam DP-200: Implementing an Azure Data Solution</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-dp-201.aspx">Exam DP-201: Designing an Azure Data Solution</a> before you continue down this path.</p>



<p>As always, I hope this article has been helpful.</p>

<p>My development activities require me to have various desktops open which can become confusing, especially if you keep to the default desktop image.   I find the best way of keeping these separated in my mind is to customize the desktop with different images.  The following two resources have worked best for me in changing up my desktop display. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>WallpaperHub.app</strong> &#8211; Desktop Images</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/michaelgillett/">Michael Gillett </a>has put together an amazing site of various Microsoft Themed desktop wallpapers at <a href="https://wallpaperhub.app">WallpaperHub.app</a>.  This has become my favorite source of wallpaper images for my various machines and virtual images.  This site also includes various community and official images.  Great collection that keeps getting updated.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>BGInfo </strong>&#8211; Display Computer Info on your Desktop</p>



<p>If you prefer to have your machine name and other information on your desktop, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/bginfo">BgInfo </a>pictured below, from Microsoft is available.   By having this program referenced in your startup folder, your information is always up to date.  I find this very useful in the various virtual machine images I run in Azure.  The information is displayed over the current desktop image.</p>



<p>Various install customization and running options are documented on the site.  I have used this program on Windows 10 and various Windows servers versions.   This is especially handy while running different Data Science Virtual Machines which may cover different clients or projects.  </p>

<p>No matter what you want to display, changing things up not only keeps you fresh, but also can help you be more productive by adding a little organization to your desktops.  </p>
